### Docker image tags

https://hub.docker.com/r/alpine/k8s/tags/

# Why we need it

Mostly it is used during CI/CD (continuous integration and continuous delivery) or as part of an automated build/deployment

# kubectl versions

You should check in [kubernetes versions](https://kubernetes.io/releases/), it lists the kubectl latest minor versions and used as image tags.

# Involve with developing and testing

If you want to build these images by yourself, please follow below commands.

```
export REBUILD=true
# comment the line in file "build.sh" to stop image push:  docker push ${image}:${tag}
bash ./build.sh
```

Second thinking, if you are adding a new tool, make sure it is supported in both `linux/amd64,linux/arm64` platforms

### Notes for krew usage

You need execute `source ~/.bashrc` before execute krew
```
$(DOCKER_CMD) bash -c "source ~/.bashrc" && kubectl krew update
$(DOCKER_CMD) bash -c "source ~/.bashrc" && kubectl krew install modify-secret ns grep
```

### Weekly build

Automation build job runs weekly by Circle CI Pipeline.
